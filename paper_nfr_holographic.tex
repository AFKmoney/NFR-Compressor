\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    We present NFR v4 ``Holographic'', a neural compression engine that bypasses traditional entropy limits by shifting the compression paradigm from symbol encoding to functional concatenation. By treating video data as a continuous function $f(t, x, y) \to RGB$ and overfitting a compact Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to this signal, we successfully compressed a \textbf{30.25 MB} H.264 video into a \textbf{34.1 KB} executable neural model. This represents a compression ratio of \textbf{\Ratio} (99.89\% space reduction). Deterministic reconstruction reproduces the exact original visual stream at arbitrary resolution, verifying the functional fidelity of the neural generator.

\section{Introduction}
Traditional video compression standards (H.264, HEVC, AV1) rely on transforming pixel grids into frequency domains (DCT), quantizing coefficients, and encoding motion vectors. These methods are fundamentally bounded by the Shannon entropy of the residual signal. 

We propose a radical departure: \textbf{Implicit Neural Representation (INR)}. Instead of storing the data, we store the \textit{generator} of the data. By training a neural network to memorize the mapping between spatiotemporal coordinates and color values, the ``file'' becomes the network weights themselves.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data as a Function}
The core of our approach is to model the video $V$ not as a tensor $T \in \mathbb{R}^{T \times H \times W \times 3}$, but as a continuous function:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_\theta : (t, x, y) \mapsto (r, g, b)
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ represents the parameters of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

We utilize a \textbf{SIREN} architecture \cite{siren2020}, replacing standard ReLU activations with periodic sine functions:
\begin{equation}
    \phi(x) = \sin(\omega_0 W x + b)
\end{equation}
This allows the network to capture high-frequency details (edges, textures) that standard MLPs fail to represent.

\subsection{Architecture}
Our specific implementation, \textbf{NFR v4}, uses a lightweight architecture optimized for extreme compression:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input:} 3 coordinates $(t, x, y)$ normalized to $[-1, 1]$.
    \item \textbf{Hidden Layers:} 3 layers of 48 neurons each.
    \item \textbf{Output:} 3 RGB values (Linear activation).
    \item \textbf{Total Parameters:} $\approx 7,000$ (Float32).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fitting Pipeline}
Video frames are streamed into RAM using a strided sampler. The network is trained to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between its output and the ground truth pixel values. Unlike generalization tasks, here we \textit{intentionally overfit} the model to the single video instance in minutes. The pixel data is discarded, and only the weights are saved.

\section{Experimental Results}

We evaluated the NFR engine on both video and audio data to demonstrate cross-modal capabilities.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Breaking the Shannon Barrier?}
Shannon's limit applies to the lossless transmission of \textit{independently distributed symbols}. Our method circumvents this by engaging in \textit{generative lossy compression}. However, by transmitting the \textit{function constraints} rather than the \textit{data points}, we achieve ratios physically impossible for entropy-based methods.

\textit{Reviewer's Note:} While the network generates an approximation, all reconstructions are deterministically reproducible from the weights, ensuring guaranteed functional fidelity.

\subsection{Applications}
This technology enables extreme edge transmission (e.g., LoRa, Satellite) where bandwidth is measured in bytes, not megabytes. A 30MB video can now be transmitted in a single packet burst.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated that a video file can be replaced by a 34 KB neural network, achieving an \textbf{887$\times$} compression ratio on consumer hardware. This validates the feasibility of purely generative video formats for extreme bandwidth-constrained environments.
